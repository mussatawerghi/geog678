# Final Project Guidelines

## 1\. Requirement

Regarding the final project, you are expected to work individually or in pair to make a web map. The final project can be simple and focused in nature, but must include:

- Host your web map on github; Then the map eventually can be visited via a url link such as `[username].github.io/[repo_name]`.
- The map should also include several map elements, such as map title, map description, overview map, legend, scale bar, north arrow, data source, credit, or acknowledgement.
- One or more **basemap** to give geographic context;
- One or more **thematic layers** that are separate from the basemap (e.g., Choropleth map, Heatmap, and etc.); and 
- One or more **interactive elements** that reveal more information (e.g., click a feature to trigger pop-up window, hover to change the style of a feature).

- A `readme.md` describes your web map, including, but not limited to,
    - Project title
    - Project description
    - Project goal (such as, what is the message you want to deliver through the map?)
    - Technical Summary: You are required to explain (1) system architecture, (2) the main functions of your web map using **either a screenshot of the web map or a code snippet of the function, and a concomitant description**.
    - Reflection on the course of designing your web map:
    - Data source
    - Libraries (e.g., Leaflet) and Web Services (e.g., github, basemap) in use
    - Credit
    - Acknowledgement
    - Other things necessary to inform the audience of your web map.

- you should use at least one web mapping technique that was **NOT** covered in the course materials, but may be introduced in the reading list or something you find over the Internet. This could, for instance, be a leaflet (or cesium) function. You don't have to specify this additional function when you draft the proposal, but as you work through the different practical exercises, you should stay aware of this function you could incorporate to meet this requirement.

## 2\. Submission

Please submit the url link of your final project's github repository to the final project submission tab on Canvas. **(by 5:00pm on December 3rd)**.

## 3\. Presentation and peer review

Academics often attend conferences where they share their discoveries and browse the work of others to gain new ideas and offer feedback. on **December 1st**, we will hold a final presentation meeting at 361 Strand Hall (the GAZE lab). Each team (made up of an individual or pair) is expected to present their final project in ~10 minutes. And there will be a F&A session in 2 ~ 3 minutes.  During the final presentation, each student will need to review all final projects and submit your review notes.


## 4\. Timeline

1. **Submit your project proposal by 5:00pm on October 9th**. The proposal should at least contain the project topic, potential audience, and the possible data sources.

2. The instructor and the TA will help each team look for data, map libraries and fine-tune the web map interface design. Each team will have one month to work on the final project.

3. In the course of this term, the instructor and the TA will regularly remind each student to work progressively towards the final project.

4. Submit the url link to the final project submission tab on Canvas **by 5:00pm on December 3rd.**

5. **On December 1st, time - noon to 2:00pm **, we will hold a final project presentation meeting at 361 strand hall.

6. You will need to submit **peer review notes** for each project right after the presentation meeting.

>  **Note:** The requirements to the final project may be slightly changed according the progress of this course. The final requirements are subject to the instructor's notification.
